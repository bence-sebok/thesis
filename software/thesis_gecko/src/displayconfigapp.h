   uses the RTC to time and toggle the EXTCOMIN pin of the Sharp memory
   LCD per default. However, the clock example wants to use the RTC to
   keep track of time, i.e. generate interrupt every second. Therefore
   the clock example implements a function (RtcIntCallbackRegister)) that
   enables the PAL to register the callback function that needs to be called in
   order to toggle the EXTCOMIN pin.
   I.e we need to undefine the INCLUDE_PAL_GPIO_PIN_AUTO_TOGGLE (which
   is defined by default and uses the RTC) and we need to define the
   PAL_TIMER_REPEAT_FUNCTION. */
